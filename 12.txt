[==========] Running 5 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 5 tests from lab2_tests
[ RUN      ] lab2_tests.tasknumber
TASKID is 5
[       OK ] lab2_tests.tasknumber (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] lab2_tests.unsynchronizedthreads
Unsynchronized threads are cdfg
[       OK ] lab2_tests.unsynchronizedthreads (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] lab2_tests.sequentialthreads
Sequential threads are ikm

[ RUN      ] lab2_tests.threadsync
tests.cpp:329: Failure
Expected: (outs.str().length()) >= (solution_len*3), actual: 43 vs 54
Output is too short.
Output for graph 5 is: abcefghidnegchafgdnkgebnmehcnhfbfdcabddaddd
Intervals are:
ab
cefg
hidn
egc
haf
gd
nkgebnmehcnhfbfdcabddaddd
tests.cpp:342: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  results.size()
    Which is: 7
  solution.size()
    Which is: 6
Invalid number of intervals. Expected 6 intervals, but found 7. Did you forget to run some threads? Otherwise maybe your threads are running for too long (or too short)?
tests.cpp:356: Failure
Value of: false
  Actual: false
Expected: true
Unexpected character 'b' was found while looking for any of 'ac'.
