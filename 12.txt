tests.cpp:342: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  results.size()
    Which is: 7
  solution.size()
    Which is: 6
Invalid number of intervals. Expected 6 intervals, but found 7. Did you forget to run some threads? Otherwise maybe your threads are running for too long (or too short)?
tests.cpp:356: Failure
Value of: false
  Actual: false
Expected: true
Unexpected character 'a' was found while looking for any of 'bcge'.
